# Markup by Attribute for WooCommerce

A WordPress plugin that adds price markup (or markdown) to WooCommerce global attribute terms. Set a price adjustment once at the attribute level, and it automatically applies to all product variations using that attribute.

## The Problem

Want to charge $5 more for every blue product? Need all X-Large items to cost 7.5% more? Without this plugin, you'd manually calculate and update every single variation.

## The Solution

Markup by Attribute lets you define price adjustments on attribute terms themselves:

- Add "+5" to the Blue color term
- Add "7.5%" to the X-Large size term
- Prices update when you use WooCommerce's bulk pricing actions

## Features

- Fixed value markups (`$5`) or percentage markups (`5%`)
- Positive markups (price increase) or negative (markdown/discount)
- Shows price differences in dropdown options for customers
- Itemized price breakdowns in variation descriptions
- Bulk update tools to reapply markups across products
- Works with both regular and sale prices
