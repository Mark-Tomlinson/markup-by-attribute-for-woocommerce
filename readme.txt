This plugin adds product variation markup by attribute to WooCommerce and adjusts product variation regular and sale prices accordingly.

== Description ==

= Varying Prices on Product Variations is Tedious and Error-Prone =

Want to add $5 to every blue product you sell? Maybe you sell jewelry with birthstones, and some stones cost more than others. If all "X-Large" products cost 7.5% more, you'd have to manually calculate and change every "X-Large" variation of every product.

= Markup by Attribute Adds 'Markup' to Attribute Terms =

Markup by Attribute solves this by letting you add a markup (or markdown) to global attribute terms. If the attribute is 'Color,' you can add "+5" to Blue while leaving Green and Yellow alone. When you set regular and sale prices, every blue product will automatically be $5.00 more.

This plugin does one thing - it adds pricing control to WooCommerce's global product attributes. If your products vary in price based on options like size, color, or material, Markup by Attribute lets you set those price differences once at the attribute level rather than manually adjusting each product variation.

= Key Features =
* Fixed value markups (like $5) or percentage markups (like 5%)
* Positive markups for price increases, negative for decreases
* Integrates with WooCommerce's existing 'Set regular price' and 'Set sale price' bulk actions
* Shows price differences in the dropdown options to help customers make informed decisions
* Provides itemized price breakdowns in variation descriptions
* Quick bulk update tools to reapply markups when values change
* Support for both regular and sale prices
* Option to show or hide markup details in various places

= Use Cases =
* Size-based pricing: Charge more for larger sizes, less for smaller sizes
* Material upgrades: Add costs for premium materials
* Add-on services: Pricing for monogramming, gift wrapping, etc.
* Attribute-driven costs: Any situation where product options consistently affect pricing

= New in Version 4.3 =
* New Base Price column for easier price management
* Improved markup visualization in the product editor
* Enhanced bulk update tools
* Better multilingual support with new translations

= Using Markup by Attribute for WooCommerce =
(Detailed instructions can be found at [Markup by Attribute Wiki](https://github.com/Mark-Tomlinson/markup-by-attribute-for-woocommerce/wiki).)

_NOTE:_ These instructions assume you are familiar with WooCommerce global Product Attributes and with WooCommerce Product Variations. If not, you may want to review the WooCommerce documentation on [Product Attributes](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/managing-product-taxonomies/#section-6) and [Variable Products](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/variable-product/).

= Three Easy Steps =

1.	**While creating new global attribute terms or editing existing ones, add the markup.**
	 * If the option needs a markup, put the amount of the markup in the term’s Markup field on either the `Add new attribute` panel or the `Edit attribute` panel.
	 * Examples of valid values include: ‘-5’, ‘5.95’, ‘+5.678’, ‘7.5%’, and ‘-12%’.
2.	**Create product variations as you normally would.**
	 * Markup by Attribute requires variable products because it changes the price of each variation.
	 * Using `Create variations from all attributes` is the easiest way to ensure you have all combinations.
	 * Do not have a variation with “Any” in an attribute with a markup because WooCommerce will choose the “Any” variation regardless of others that may exist. So, if XX-Large is 5% more, you cannot have one variation for “XX-Large” and another for “Any size” to cover the rest because WooCommerce assumes “Any size” includes “XX-Large”.
3.	**Use the `Set regular price` and `Set sale price` bulk edit functions as you normally would.**
	 * The markup will be applied to the price according to the attribute terms associated with the variation.
	 * A description of the markup will be added to the variation description.
		```
		Product Price 18.95
		Add 2.00 for Logo
		```
	 * _TIP_: Always set the regular price before setting a sale price. Percentage markups are calculated on the regular price, so they cannot be applied to a sale price if the regular price has not been set.
	 * _TIP_: If you change a markup value later, you can quickly update affected products using:
		- The "Reapply Markups" bulk action on the Products list
		- The refresh icon beneath the attributes of individual products in the list
		- The "Reapply markups to prices" option in the product's variation bulk actions

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does Markup-by-Attribute automatically update prices when I change a markup? =

**No - and this is by design.** Markup-by-Attribute only applies markups when you take specific action:
1. When you use WooCommerce's `Set regular prices` or `Set sale prices` bulk action
2. When you use one of the "Reapply markups" tools

This intentional workflow gives you control over when prices change. You might want existing inventory to keep old prices while new products use updated markups.

**Bottom line**: Setting a markup is step 1. Applying it to products is step 2.

= If I change the markup for an attribute, how will product prices change? =

After changing a markup value, you have several ways to update the affected products:
1. For new products or variations, Markup-by-Attribute is incorporated into the `Set regular price` bulk action to set the variation price with the appropriate markup.
2. For existing products:
- Use the "Reapply Markups" bulk action to update multiple products at once
- Click the refresh icon next to individual products to update them one at a time
- In the product editor, use "Reapply markups to prices" in the variations bulk actions

= How do I bulk update prices for multiple products at once? =

If you change a markup value for an option, you can quickly update affected products in one of two ways.
1. There is a `Reapply Markups` bulk action on the 'All Products' product list. You can even select all items on the page, and Markup-by-Attribute will find items with markups and update the prices and descriptions.
2. There is a refresh icon beneath the attributes of individual products on the 'All Products' product list. You can filter the list by selecting the attribute in question and then click "⟳ Reprice" on the products that you want to reapply the markup to.

Additionally, a "Reapply markups to prices" option in the product's variation bulk actions. While this only works on the product you are editing, it does provide a method that is faster than setting the prices again.

= What happens to existing markups when I change an attribute's settings? =

Nothing. Products have to have their prices set again ("Set regular prices" in the variation bulk actions), or you can do a bulk reapplication of the markup to many products at once (see above).

Not automatically changing the variation prices is important if a shop has existing inventory they want to sell at the original markup and new products that require the new markup. You can select which products retain their old prices and which ones are repriced with the new markup.

= Can I use both percentage and fixed-amount markups together? =

Yes! Usually, attributes like 'Size' will have a percentage markup, whereas attributes like stitching a logo on a shirt will be fixed in price. Combining both the size markup and the logo markup on the same product is perfectly valid. But what if you want to add a percentage and a fixed-price markup to two of the same attributes? For instance, anything that is plaid gets marked up by 5%, but anything yellow is reduced by $1. You can do this, too.

Any option listed under any attribute is calculated independently of any other. Any combination of positive or negative amounts or percentages is all valid.

= How do markups work with sale prices? =

Fixed-amount markups are added to (or subtracted from) sales prices, just as they are for regular prices. However, percentage markups can be calculated on sale prices in one of two ways.
1. The markup is calculated on the regular price and then applied to the sales price.
2. The markup is calculated on the sale price before being applied to the sale price.

You decide which way you want the percentage markups calculated with the **Sale Price Markup** option on the Markup-by-Attribute settings page.

= It's not working. Why? =

**The #1 reason**: You've set markups but haven't applied them to products yet.

Markup-by-Attribute requires TWO steps:
1. **Set the markup** on the attribute term (✓ You probably did this)
2. **Apply it to products** using bulk actions (← This is usually the missing step)

**On the product page**: Use WooCommerce's `Set regular prices` or `Reapply markups to prices` bulk actions on the Variations tab.
**On the product list**: Use the `Reapply Markups` bulk action or the refresh icon next to individual products.

**Other common issues**:
- Variations with "Any" attributes when those attributes have markups
- Expecting automatic price updates (this plugin requires deliberate action)

If none of these solve it, check the support forums.

= What if I change an attribute's markups but do not want to change products marked up previously? =

Then do nothing. Prices, descriptions, and option drop-downs for products will remain at whatever value they were set to last time you ran the `Set regular price` or `Reapply markups to price` bulk variation actions.

= Does this support languages other than English? =

Yes. However, the developer only speaks American English. I can provide translations via OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude. But I would prefer it if a native speaker translated the text. The .POT file is found in the /languages folder of the plugin. If you don't have access to your server, you can also find it on [GitHub](https://github.com/Mark-Tomlinson/markup-by-attribute-for-woocommerce).

What's a .POT file? If you'd like to help but don't know how to use a template file, don't worry. A .POT file is a text file that contains all the English phrases found in Markup-by-Attribute. You can simply open it and translate what you read there. Send me the translations, and I will incorporate them in the next release.

Many thanks to [Zjadlbymcos](https://github.com/Zjadlbymcos) on GitHub for his Polish translation and @silentstepsch for several variations of German.

= I'd like to donate. =

Thanks! The donation button assumes $5.00 USD. But please don't hesitate to adjust that amount up or down as you feel it's appropriate. I'm a retired guy who's living off his savings, so every little bit helps.

If you use Markup-by-Attribute and want to see me continue support for it, I encourage you to encourage me with a small donation.

 * Initial version.

== Upgrade Notice ==

= 3.11 =

Ensured compatibility with current versions of WordPress, WooCommerce, and PHP. Resolved a PHP 'depreciation' warning.

Fixed a bug where Markup-by-Attribute would get confused about the decimal separator because the server and WooCommerce localization settings conflicted.

= 3.9 =

Added a new feature that allows Markup-by-Attribute to add the markup to the name of the option. This is useful when the dropdown box has been replaced by color swatches, checkboxes, or some other selector. As long as the name of the option is displayed (for instance, when the cursor hovers over it), then the markup will be seen by your customer.

Fixed a bug where Markup-by-Attribute would overwrite the options' selector for some themes and other plugins. This occurs if the theme or plugin provided changed the function of the options' selector (for instance, to color swatches) and did not code it so that they take precedence.

= 1.3.1 =

 * Includes clearer instructions and inline help.
 * Repairs how percentage markups are displayed.

= 1.2.0 =

 * Now allows the use of percentage (5%) markups and markdowns, as well as fixed values ($5).
 * And it stores the actual markup value displayed in the attribute drop-down with the product. This allows changing of the markup in the attribute without affecting the markup displayed with the product.

= 1.1.1 =

Prevents null prices (due to an apparent bug in WooCommerce sale_price) from being adjusted with a markup.

= 1.1 =

 * Markup is now stored in metadata, freeing up the Description field. Edits are added to the code, so the markup will always be stored in the correct format.
 * Code improvements to add robustness and supportability.
