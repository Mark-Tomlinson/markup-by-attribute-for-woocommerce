This plugin adds product variation markup by attribute to WooCommerce and adjusts product variation regular and sale prices accordingly.

== Description ==

= Varying Prices on Product Variations is Tedious and Error-Prone =

Want to add $5 to every blue product you sell? Maybe you sell jewelry with birthstones and some stones just cost more than others. If all "X-Large" products cost 7.5% more, you have to manually calculate and change every "X-Large" variation of every product.

= Markup by Attribute Adds 'Markup' to Attribute Terms =

Markup by Attribute solves this problem by allowing you to add a markup (or markdown) to global attribute terms. If the attribute is 'color', then Markup by Attribute allows you to add "+5" to Blue while leaving Green and Yellow alone. When you set regular and sale prices, every blue product will be $5.00 more.

Markup by Attribute:

* Can create a fixed value markup (such as $5), or a percentage markup (such as 5%).
* The markup value can be positive yielding an increase in price, or negative yielding a decrease in price.
* Uses familiar WooCommerce bulk edit actions `Set regular price` and `Set sale price`.
* Puts the price increase (or decrease) in the options drop-down box along side of the terms so customers can make informed decisions. (Or, optionally, does not).
* Can write a breakdown of the price modifications in the variation description so the itemization is visible to the customer.
* Has been tested with Gutenberg and is fully compatible.

= Using Markup by Attribute for WooCommerce =

_NOTE:_ These instructions assume you are familiar with WooCommerce global Product Attributes and with WooCommerce Product Variations. If not, you may want to review the WooCommerce documentation on [Product Attributes](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/managing-product-taxonomies/#section-6) and [Variable Products](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/variable-product/).

# Three Easy Steps #

1.  **While creating new global attribute terms or editing existing ones, add the markup.**
    * If the option needs a markup, put the amount of the markup in the term’s Markup field on either the `Add new attribute` panel or the `Edit attribute` panel.
    * Examples of valid values include: ‘-5’, ‘5.95’, ‘+5.678’, ‘7.5%’, and ‘-12%’.
1.  **Create product variations as you normally would.**
    * Markup by Attribute requires variable products because it changes the price of each variation.
    * It is recommended that you use the `Create variations from all attributes` function to ensure all variations are represented.
1.  **Use the `Set regular price` and `Set sale price` bulk edit functions as you normally would.**  (_NOTE: If you’ve already set the prices before installing Markup by Attribute, you will need to do it again to apply the markup_).
    * The markup will be applied to the price according to the attribute terms associated with the variation.
    * A description of the markup will be added to the variation description.
      ```
      Product Price 18.95
      Add 2.00 for Logo
      ```
    * _TIP_: If you change the markup at a later date, repeat this step to recalculate the markup for this product. Or do not repeat the step to leave the previous markups unchanged.
    * _TIP_: Always set the regular price before setting a sale price. Percentage markups are calculated on the regular price, so they can not be applied to a sale price if the regular price has not been set.

# Advanced #

Because the markup description is bracketed in `<span>` tags, CSS can be used to modify its appearance on the product page. Simply modify the id "#mbainfo".
    ```
    #mbainfo {
        color: salmon;
    }
    ```

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this support languages other than English? =

Yes. However, the developer only speaks American English.  I can provide 'Google Translate' versions of other languages, but I would prefer it if a native speaker translated the text. The .POT file is found in the /languages folder of the plugin. If you don't have access to your server, you can also find it on [GitHub](https://github.com/Mark-Tomlinson/markup-by-attribute-for-woocommerce).

What's a .POT file? If you'd like to help but don't know how to use a template file, don't worry. A .POT file is a text file that contains all the English phrases found in Markup by Attribute.  You can simply open it and translate what you read there.  Send me the translations and I will incorporate them in the next release.

Many thanks to [Zjadlbymcos](https://github.com/Zjadlbymcos) on GitHub for his Polish Translation.

= If I change the markup for an attribute, how will product prices change? =

Markup by Attribute works within the framework provided by WooCommerce and sets product variation markups (or markdowns) during the `Set regular price` and `Set sale price` actions. Therefore, you must locate the products affected by this change and reset the regular and sale prices. I'm working on adding an "Attribute" column to the Product list to facilitate this type of activity.

= What if I change an attribute's markups but do not want to change products marked up previously? =

Then do nothing. Prices, descriptions, and option drop-downs for products will remain at whatever value they were set to last time you ran the `Set regular price` or `Set sale price` bulk variation activities.

= I'd like to donate. =

Thanks! The donation button assumes $15.00 USD. But feel free to adjust that amount up or down as you feel it's appropriate. I'm a retired guy who's living off his savings, so every little bit helps.

If you use Markup-by-Attribute and want to see me continuing support for it, I encourage you to encourage me with a small donation.

== Screenshots ==

1. Note the addition of the "Markup (or markdown)" field on the bottom of the `Add new *attribute*` panel of the attribute editor.
2. Note the addition of the "Markup (or markdown)" field on the bottom of the `Edit *attribute*` screen of the attribute editor.
3. The regular price is $18.95. Markup by Attribute added $6 for a logo and $1.42 for extra large.
4. The customer sees the full range of sale prices available and how much each option costs, plus a clear description of the breakdown.
5. Markdowns (negative markups) can be used as well.
6. Markups are applied to sale prices just as they are to regular prices.
7. The settings page allows configuration of how the markup is displayed.

== Changelog ==

= 3.2 =
* Feature: Add option to calculate percentage markups from sale prices rather than regular prices.
* Fix: Option 'Do NOT show the markup in the options drop-down box' showed slug in drop-down box instead of term name. Corrected to always show name for global attributes.

* Maintenance: Added donation language to Settings page.

* Feature: Fully tested with Gutenberg.
* Feature: Added Polish language files.

= 3.0 =

To patch around it, version 2.3 will put the percentage in the drop-down instead of the actual markup. These items will need to have their regular prices reset in order to have the actual markup appear.
